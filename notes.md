# What I did
- gem install veewee-to-packer
- Cloned veewee and copied templates/ubuntu-13.04-server-adm64 out of
the repository (or else you'll get some annoyances with rbenv)

# Good to know
- Removed the vmware builder
- ruby.sh takes a long time - might not need it for my uses.
- Could just create a salt.sh that installs salt and the correct Python
- Include the EC2 user data as well
